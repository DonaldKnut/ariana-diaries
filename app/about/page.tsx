              I&apos;ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and
              wrote my first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks
              after my mom brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I
              taught myself to type on.

              The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space.
              When I was 8, I climbed the 40-foot oak tree at the back of our
              yard while wearing my older sister&apos;s motorcycle helmet,
              counted down from three, and jumped — hoping the tree was tall
              enough that with just a bit of momentum I&apos;d be able to get to
              orbit.
            </p>
            <p>
              I spent the next few summers indoors working on a rocket design,
              while I recovered from the multiple surgeries it took to fix my
              badly broken legs. It took nine iterations, but when I was 15 I
              sent my dad&aposs Blackberry into orbit and was able to transmit a
              photo back down to our family computer from space.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I&apos;m the founder of Planetaria, where we&apos;re
              working on civilian space suits and manned shuttle kits you can
              assemble at home so that the next generation of kids really{" "}
              <em>can</em> make it to orbit — from the comfort of their own
              backyards.
